# Space-Invaders-POO

This was the final project for the Object Oriented Programming course I took in the second semester of 2020. 

The project is coded in Java. I started the project using Swing (the old version), then I switched to using JavaFX, and implemented a lot more features in to the game (master branch)

All the documentation I submitted along with the main code is included in this repository, which is in portuguese.

To run the game, you can simply install the latest version of Java available, download the java executable file (Space-Invaders-POO/SpaceInvaders/dist/SpaceInvadersFX.jar) and run it.
